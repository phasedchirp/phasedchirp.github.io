#### Experience:

**Kaiser Foundation Health Plan** (May 2017-present)

> *Business Analyst*: Data analysis and predictive analytics for large-scale healthcare data.

> * Integrate predictive modeling tools production ETL processes using SAS/SQL to forecast usage and costs for millions of customers during expansion of Kaiser's data infrastructure.
* Build automated and interactive anomaly detection in SAS and R to monitor data source quality.
* Introduce version control and other development best practices into team workflows.
* Work to build shared resources and reduce duplication across several predictive modeling projects.

**Consultant** (September 2015 -- May 2017)

> Worked with clients to build automated, reproducible, and interpretable data analysis pipelines addressing academic and business needs from ingesting raw data to interpretable output. Projects included:

> * Bayesian modeling of individual behavior and contextual variability to examine how speakers use socio-linguistic features to construct and present ethnic identity.
* Designed/prototyped/iterated to deployment a web service for reproducible analysis of SEO data for RankScience. Deployed in production using Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk platform.

**Recurse Center** (July 2016 -- September 2016)

> Self-directed continuing education in programming. Projects included:

> * Prototype tools for real-time/streaming data analysis and machine learning in Haskell.
* Satirical random number generator using real-time Twitter data as an entropy source.

**NYU Phonetics and Experimental Phonology (PEP) Lab** (May 2011 -- September 2015)

> *Lab Manager*: Developed data collection and analysis pipelines, consulting for students and faculty.

> * Re-built and streamlined tongue-shape analysis pipeline, reduced space for user error, and improved statistical graphics.
* Migrated lab processes to open-source tools freely available to students.

> *Research Assistant*: Investigated phonetic and phonological factors in non-native speech perception. PIs Lisa Davidson and Colin Wilson, NSF Grant 1052784
