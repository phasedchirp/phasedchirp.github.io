#### Education:

 **PhD**, Linguistics. New York University (September 2015)  


* Speech perception, quantitative methods, and using machine learning to understand cognitive processes.

**BA**, Linguistics. University of California, Los Angeles (May 2008)

#### Programming Languages:

Applied Statistics and Machine learning, Bayesian methods, Experimental Design, Data Visualization.
Programming experience in R, Python, SQL, SAS.


#### Experience:

**Kaiser Foundation Health Plan** (Business Analyst Intermediate 5/17-4/19, Senior 4/19-present):

> Data science and data engineering for large-scale healthcare data.

> * Building interactive web-based tools using R, Shiny, and MS Synapse to enable self-service analytics for clinical staff seeking to evaluate program outcomes.
* Rebuilt and streamlined legacy data pipelines during large-scale expansion of data infrastructure to introduce consistent logic for claims data processing across all Kaiser regions.
* Integrated predictive modeling into data pipelines using SAS to forecast
costs and service volumes for external claims.
* Built tools for interactive anomaly detection, visualization, and analysis in SAS and R.

**Consultant** (September 2015 -- May 2017)

> Worked with clients to build automated, reproducible, and interpretable data analysis pipelines addressing academic and business needs from ingesting raw data to interpretable output. Projects included:

> * Bayesian modeling of individual behavior and contextual variability to examine how speakers use socio-linguistic features to construct and present ethnic identity.
* Designed/prototyped/iterated to deployment a web service for reproducible analysis of SEO data for RankScience. Deployed in production using Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk platform.

**Recurse Center** (July 2016 -- September 2016)

> Self-directed continuing education in programming. Projects included:

> * Prototype tools for real-time/streaming data analysis and machine learning in Haskell.
* Satirical random number generator using real-time Twitter data as an entropy source.

**NYU Phonetics and Experimental Phonology (PEP) Lab** (Lab Manager/RA May 2011 -- September 2015)

* Developed data collection and analysis pipelines, consulting for students and faculty.
* Re-built tongue-shape analysis pipeline. Streamlined procedures and reduced space for user error.
* Migrated analysis pipelines to open-source tools.
* Investigated phonetic and phonological factors in non-native speech perception, supervised undergraduate RAs. PIs Lisa Davidson and Colin Wilson, NSF Grant 1052784
