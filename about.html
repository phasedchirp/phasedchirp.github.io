        <h2>About me:</h2>
                <p>I currently work as a data analyst at Kaiser Permanente where I've been working on integrating predictive modeling into large-scale data processing pipelines.</p>
                <p>I also sometimes provide consulting on data analysis and experimental design for linguists and other social and behavioral researchers</p>
                <p>I'm also interested in the application of machine learning techniques in understanding human behavior</p>
                <p>I finished a Ph.D. in Linguistics at the <a href="http://linguistics.as.nyu.edu">NYU Department of Linguistics</a> in September 2015. My <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/14rvsq0p2afk8ic/Martin_diss_DRAFT.pdf">dissertation</a> focused on phonetic category learning in (simulated) second language acquisition.</p>
