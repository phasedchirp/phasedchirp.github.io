title: "Grid approximations with Haskell"
date: 2016-02-01

This post outlines a first attempt at using Haskell for Bayesian inference, using a grid approximation. To do this,

This project uses the `Data.List` and `Control.Applicative` modules

First step is implementing generating a grid of points. This is fairly straightforward:

{% highlight Haskell %}
-- generate a grid of points:


{% endhighlight %}

Then, the probability density needs to be evaluated at each point:

{% highlight Haskell %}
-- generate a list of n prime numbers

{% endhighlight %}

The next project will possibly be something slightly more practical.
